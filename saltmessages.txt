Thanks for throwing the game! 
Surpise! So and so wins again. 
Wake me when you're done durdling.
I've played this deck X times and still haven't seen Y?! 
Wake me up before you combo. 
Sick Crypt -> Ring -> Signet -> Creature. Tapland, go. 
Yeah, hit me with your mana dork turn 2, peasant.
Why are you guys focusing me? I only took 3 turns in a row
Why are you focusing me? I have one land and it's turn 6?
How dare you take out my creature that I was about to win the game with?
But I didn't do anything to you, why would you take out my creature?
Fine. I swing with my Birds of Paradise
That's fine, it's only the 7th boardwipe you played this game
*THIS* is for last game
Sure, waste your answers when there is a **REAL** threat over there!
Did you HAVE to Stifle my FETCH?
Are y'all on a secret team or something?
Fine, guess I don't get to play the game **AGAIN**
Nice cEDH deck you brought there, tryhard
Gonna draw a land one of these days...
No. Drinks. On. The. Table.
Sigh, guess I have to mulligan. Again.
I said any power level, not cedh!
You're such a lucksack
Great to see I'm the only player running removal
Mana denial. So fun.
No, it's fine, I love playing against a Three-Headed-Giant.
Sure, waste your removal on my ramp.
I've literally never seen anyone counter this before, but go ahead, I guess.
Five mana on turn 3? Yeah that's super casual.
You actually hardcast Fierce Guardianship on my Sol Ring?
You're targeting me? I'm not the threat right now.
Just because I won last game doesn't mean you need to be targeting me this game.
You're only attacking me because I don't have good blocks, but whatever.
If you guys had let me win weâ€™d have shuffled up and started a new game by now.
You're playing X? Prepare to get hated out of the game.
Why do I go last EVERY GAME?
Tell me how to beat you, and let me do it, or I will punch you.
Attack them, not me!
Play slower man. It's truly a delight to play someone who moves this glacially
You're right - it is better to be lucky than good.
Nice netdeck you got there. Must have been so hard to come up with it.
Look at moneybags here with their Gaea's Cradle and Mana Crypt.
How is that card not banned yet?
\**insert rant about pay-to-win*\*
Wow, a blue deck with Rhystic Study! How original.
Oh, you only use me for my salt function, huh?
:salt:
